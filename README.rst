Introduction
============

``tmprep`` is designed to create a usable control file for TURBOMOLE > version 7.5.
Useful settings are predefined. The files .CHRG and .UHF containing integer numbers
for charge and unpaired number of electrons are read. Settings as defined in the 
~/.cefinerc are read and are compatible to ``tmprep``. The number of electrons which 
are printed out are only calculated within ``tmprep`` and do not stem from an EHT guess.

**WARNING**

    This work is in development and should not be used in production runs!
    (The warning mainly focuses on the creation of the basis and auxbasis files!)

Setup:
======

Download tmprep.py and make it executable:

.. code:: bash

    $ chmod u+x tmprep.py


Usage example:
==============

.. code:: bash

    $ tmprep.py -func r2scan-3c -scfconv 7 -radsize 10 -cosmo 80.0 -sym c1

The basis and auxbasis files can be generated by ``tmprep`` and this can be prone 
to errors so use with caution.

.. code:: bash

    $ tmpprep.py -gen_bas -gen_auxbas <other settings>


Otherwise ridft will generate the basis and auxbasis files.
